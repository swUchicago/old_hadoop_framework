  <td>Reduced buffer copies as data is written to HDFS.
  The order of sending data bytes and control information has changed, but this
  will not be observed by client applications.</td>

  <td>Improved management of replicas of the name space
  image. If all replicas on the Name Node are lost, the latest check point can
  be loaded from the secondary Name Node. Use parameter
  &quot;-importCheckpoint&quot; and specify the location with &quot;fs.checkpoint.dir.&quot;
  The directory structure on the secondary Name Node has changed to match the
  primary Name Node.</td>

  <td><a
  href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2656">HADOOP-2656</a></td>

  <td>Withdrew the upgrade-to-CRC facility. HDFS will no
  longer support upgrades from versions without CRCs for block data. Users
  upgrading from version 0.13 or earlier must first upgrade to an intermediate
  (0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17) version before doing upgrade to version 0.18 or
  later.</td>

  <td>dfs</td>
  <td>Added a new public interface Syncable which declares
  the sync() operation. FSDataOutputStream implements Syncable. If the
  wrappedStream in FSDataOutputStream is Syncalbe, calling
  FSDataOutputStream.sync() is equivalent to call wrappedStream.sync(). Otherwise,
  FSDataOutputStream.sync() is a no-op. Both DistributedFileSystem and
  LocalFileSystem support the sync() operation.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><a
  href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3187">HADOOP-3187</a></td>
  <td>dfs</td>
  <td>Introduced directory quota as hard limits on the
  number of names in the tree rooted at that directory. An administrator may
  set quotas on individual directories explicitly. Newly created directories
  have no associated quota. File/directory creations fault if the quota would
  be exceeded. The attempt to set a quota faults if the directory would be in
  violation of the new quota.</td>
